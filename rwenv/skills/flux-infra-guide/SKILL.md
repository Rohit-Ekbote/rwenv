# Flux Infrastructure Guide

Quick reference for navigating the RunWhen infrastructure managed by Flux CD.

## When to Use This Skill

- Debugging service issues (unhealthy pods, failed migrations)
- Finding where a service/config is defined
- Understanding how secrets and config flow into services
- Querying logs and metrics for a specific service
- Tracing Flux reconciliation failures

## Prerequisites

- rwenv must be set (`/rwenv-cur` to verify)
- For Flux CLI commands: dev container running
- For log queries: access to observability stack

## Loading Data Files

This skill uses lazy loading. Read data files only when needed:

| Question Type | Data File |
|---------------|-----------|
| Service location ("where does X run") | `data/services.json` |
| Flux status ("why isn't X syncing") | `data/flux-resources.json` |
| Secrets ("where does X get credentials") | `data/secrets-map.json` |
| Config ("what value does X have") | `data/configmaps.json` |

Data files are located in this skill's `data/` directory.

---

## Service Map

Quick lookup for where services run.

### How to Use

For service location questions ("where does X run", "what namespace is Y"):
1. Read `data/services.json` from this skill's directory
2. Find the service entry
3. Use namespace/deployment info for kubectl commands

### Data Format (services.json)

```json
{
  "services": {
    "papi": {
      "namespace": "backend-services",
      "deployment": "papi",
      "fluxPath": "apps/backend-services/",
      "kustomization": "runwhen-backend-services",
      "description": "Platform API - core backend service"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generatedFrom": "infra-flux-nonprod-test",
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-02T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Common Namespaces

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `backend-services` | Core platform services (PAPI, Celery, etc.) |
| `flux-system` | Flux controllers and sources |
| `linkerd` | Service mesh control plane |
| `loki` | Log aggregation |
| `mimir` | Metrics storage |
| `vault` | Secrets management |
| `cortex` | Application metrics |
| `llm-gateway` | LLM proxy services |
| `runner-system` | Runner infrastructure |
| `corestate` | State management |
| `gitservice` | Git integration |

---

## Flux Resources

Inventory of Kustomizations and HelmReleases managed by Flux.

### How to Use

For Flux status questions ("why isn't X syncing", "what manages Y"):
1. Read `data/flux-resources.json` from this skill's directory
2. Find the Kustomization or HelmRelease
3. Check status with `flux get kustomization <name>` or `flux get helmrelease <name>`

### Data Format (flux-resources.json)

```json
{
  "kustomizations": {
    "runwhen-backend-services": {
      "namespace": "flux-system",
      "path": "./apps/backend-services",
      "sourceRef": "flux-system",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "interval": "1m",
      "prune": true,
      "manages": ["papi", "celery-worker", "celery-beat", "activities", "alerts"]
    }
  },
  "helmReleases": {
    "loki": {
      "namespace": "loki",
      "chart": "loki",
      "chartSource": "grafana",
      "interval": "5m"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generatedFrom": "infra-flux-nonprod-test",
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-02T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Debugging Flux Failures

**IMPORTANT: Check Flux status FIRST before debugging config issues.**

Many "config not applied" issues are actually failed HelmRelease upgrades or Kustomization reconciliation errors.

**Check order when something isn't deploying:**

1. GitRepository: `flux get source git flux-system -n flux-system`
2. Kustomization: `flux get kustomization <name> -n flux-system`
3. HelmRelease (if applicable): `flux get helmrelease <name> -n <namespace>`
4. Events: `kubectl get events -n flux-system --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`

**Common failure patterns:**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Kustomization stuck "Reconciling" | Dependency not ready | Check `dependsOn` resources first |
| HelmRelease "upgrade retries exhausted" | Helm hook failed (migration) | `kubectl logs job/<release>-<hook> -n <namespace>` |
| "path not found" | Wrong path in Kustomization | Verify path exists in Flux repo |
| Config not updating | HelmRelease failed silently | `flux get helmrelease -A` to check all statuses |

## Secrets Map

How secrets flow from Vault into services via CSI driver.

### How to Use

For secrets questions ("where does X get credentials", "why is secret missing"):
1. Read `data/secrets-map.json` from this skill's directory
2. Find the service's secret configuration
3. Trace from Vault path → SecretProviderClass → Pod mount

### Data Format (secrets-map.json)

```json
{
  "secretProviderClasses": {
    "vault-papi": {
      "namespace": "backend-services",
      "provider": "vault",
      "vaultRole": "shared_secrets",
      "vaultMountPath": "kubernetes-${cluster_name}",
      "secrets": [
        {
          "vaultPath": "shared/data/secrets",
          "vaultKey": "secrets.py",
          "k8sSecretName": "papi-secrets",
          "mountPath": "/secrets/secrets.py"
        }
      ],
      "usedBy": ["papi", "celery-worker", "celery-beat"]
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generatedFrom": "infra-flux-nonprod-test",
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-02T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Secret Flow Diagram

```
Vault (source of truth)
    │
    ├── Path: shared/data/secrets
    │
    ▼
SecretProviderClass (vault-papi)
    │
    ├── vaultRole: shared_secrets
    ├── vaultMountPath: kubernetes-${cluster_name}
    │
    ▼
CSI Volume Mount (in Pod spec)
    │
    ├── mountPath: /secrets/
    │
    ▼
Pod reads secret file at /secrets/secrets.py
```

### Debugging Secrets

**Check order when secrets are missing:**

1. SecretProviderClass exists: `kubectl get secretproviderclass -n <namespace>`
2. Vault auth working: `kubectl logs -n vault vault-0 | grep auth`
3. CSI driver running: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver`
4. Pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod> -n <namespace>` (look for mount errors)

**Common failure patterns:**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| "secret not found" on pod start | Vault role missing/wrong | Vault policy for `kubernetes-${cluster_name}` |
| Pod stuck in ContainerCreating | CSI driver timeout | CSI driver pods, Vault connectivity |
| Secret file empty | Vault path incorrect | `vault kv get shared/data/secrets` |
